# TwitterApp
### In my Web Development course, I made an interactive, Twitter-style web application. 
### The web app displays recent tweets and associated information like a news feed. It allows users to post, edit, and delete their own tweets, as well as retweet and reply to other tweets. 
### The web app uses AJAX + JSON to send requests to a course-specific back-end API server with 7 RESTful endpoints.
